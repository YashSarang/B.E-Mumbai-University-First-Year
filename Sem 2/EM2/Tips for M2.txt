Applied Mathematics - II





1. You may need to go to tuitions for Maths.
2. It's far more difficult than Applied Mathematics - I.
3. Clear out your confusions as soon as possible. Or you'll be looking
   at the paper with big eyes in the exam.
4. This subject carries 5 credits. Your pointer will be affected if
   you don't score.
5. Pracitce Maths in college in the lectures itself. Beleive me, this
   helps to save time for other theory subjects.
6. Theory subjects are sometimes difficult to study in college because
   of the noise around in the classroom. Maths can be done at such times.
7. 90% of the students use G. V. Kumbhojkar for Maths which is known
   as the God of Maths books. Remember, Kumbhojkar is not an answer book.
   It's a text book where there are exercises unsolved with a few solved
   examples at the start.
8. For me, notes from classes were better. If you're fine with
   Kumbhojkar, go for it.
9. I joined Shantanu Pal's Crash Course and found it really, really
   helpful.
10. Differential Equations and Double Integration is all what is you
    need to study this time.
11.
