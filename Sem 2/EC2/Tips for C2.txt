Applied Chemistry - II





1. No tuitions needed.
2. Focus on Maths, SPA and Drawing more 'cause they carry more credits
   which will affect your pointer.
3. Technical book are good according to exam point of view.
4. Buy reference books if you want to actually know about the subject.
   Books as per the syllabus of Mumbai University are enough for passing
   in exams.
5. Numericals are the key to pass this time.
6. The numericals are very easy once you understand the pattern in
   which they're solved. They fetch you much more marks than the work you
   do to study them!
7. The theory related to numericals in books (at least in Techincal)
   need not be learned. Learned as in you just need to read it once and
   start with the numericals.
8. Theory explaining the numericals is never asked in exams, it's just
   for your understanding of what is happening in the numerical.
9. You may find it easier than Applied Chemistry - I.
10. Corrosion is a very imporant chapter. It is easy once you
    understand how something corrodes relating to the anode and cathode
    concept.
11. Alloys is a chapter where you need to memorize and learn a lot.
12. A numerical based on the easiest topic in Chemistry you've ever
    studied, i.e., Atom Economy is sure to come. Don't leave it at any
    cose.
13. Also, Synthesis of Adipic Acid / Indigo is a compulsury question
    in the end semester exams.
14. Memorize less and understand more in this time for Chemistry II.
